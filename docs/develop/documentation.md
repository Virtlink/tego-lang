# Documentation
The Tego documentation follows the documentation system [outlined by Daniele Procida][1]. It divides the documentation into the following sections:

- **Getting Started** - Anything to do with getting started, finding releases, downloading source code, and installation.
- **Tutorials** - Practical learning instruments that show and explain various techniques and concepts by taking the user's hand toward a pre-defined goal.
- **How-Tos** - Practical problem-oriented guides on how to achieve a particular goal.
- **Reference** - Reference information.
- **Background** - Background information, explanations, and design documents.
- **Develop** - Information on contributing and the repository structure.


## Adding Pages
When adding pages, add them to the `nav:` element in `/mkdocs.yml` in the root of this project as well.
