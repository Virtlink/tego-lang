# Tego

Tego is a _lazy function language_ that compiles to Java bytecode. Its primary use is to specify _search strategies_ for the implementation of various editor services.

Tego is experimental and still work-in-progress. Its syntax and implementation are not stable yet, and it lacks documentation, test coverage, and benchmarks.
